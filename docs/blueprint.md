## Style Guidelines:

- The overall intention of the app is a professional tool to assist the user in extracting important information. Basing our choices on those aspects, a dark color scheme will be used. Primary color: Soft Blue (#64B5F6) for clarity and calmness.
- Background color: Dark gray (#333333) to ensure text is easily readable.
- Accent color: Light blue (#81D4FA) for interactive elements and highlights to provide a clear visual focus.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, creating a balance of tech and readability.
- Use clean, professional icons to represent different document types and actions. Icons should be monochromatic.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy to enhance usability.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
